I'm a web enthusiast who loves to create new things and tackle challenging problems with intelligent concepts.

I put a lot of commitment into my work, seeking opportunities to craft aesthetic products across the digital spectrum while creating interactive and cross platform experiences.

Currently I'm based in Ljubljana, Slovenia, working as a art director with extremely talented and great people at Enki. You think I've got what it takes to make your idea come to life? Maybe you just like my sense of humour and would like to chat with me? Drop a message and I'll make sure to get in touch as soon as possible.

After being graduated from the Gobelins School as a Multimedia Designer/Director, I joined Electronlibre, a kick ass swiss agency based in Lausanne. Working with a lot of different clients, building planty of awesome projects and having fun with hundreds of experimentations. 

I like getting inspiration from anything, using it to bring a concept to life and working with great people to create unique experiences.
